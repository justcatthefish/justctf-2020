When I was very young, I made mods for various games.
I think I was developing very secure plugins at the time.
Can you check my old plugins?

BTW you don't need to exploit the TF2 game engine!

Hints:
* Sandbox setup info. We are only changing outside ports. All ports inside container are same like in task.zip. Our example sandbox docker-compose looks like:
```
    ports:
      - 27016:27015/udp
      - 27016:27015/tcp
      - 81:80
```
* Have you found the backdoor?
